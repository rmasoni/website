          <p>I was incredibly fortunate to work as a web designer, developer and illustrator for most of my life.</p>
          <p>It was a great journey during which I experienced the startup scene in its infancy, and evolved with web standards and development methodologies over the years, all while learning and growing alongside amazing professionals.</p>
          <p>In 2016, I shifted my career from full-time web design to running my own online language & culture school <span class="muted">(which has benefited greatly from my skills)</span>.</p>
