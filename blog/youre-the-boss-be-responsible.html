          <p>This rant isn’t directed at anyone in particular; its very existence is only due to the fact that I have faced this situation more than one would ever want.</p>
          <p>Here’s the typical story:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>You have a startup and you need a freelancer to get some things done — a landing page, a mobile app, tests for your API, copy for your new homepage, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>You search for people on various sites and filter through a bunch that you deem apt to do the job, and contact them <span class="muted">(often with urgency)</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>A few of these promptly answer you, and you engage in a conversation about the project and what they can actually do for you.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Maybe one will have a preliminary version or presentation of the work in a couple of hours or the next day. Either way, this is my piece of advice: <em>get back to them</em>.</p>
          <p>We see articles every so often about how designers, developers, writers, and other creatives should never leave their clients waiting or unanswered. I’m certain this rule should also extend to bosses and contractors.</p>
          <p>I know that running a company isn’t easy and that your calendar looks like widescreen Tetris, but you have to realize that these professionals should also be included in your schedule.</p>
          <p>Don’t leave <em>people</em> unanswered. They shouldn’t be left wondering if the e-mail has reached you or not. Need more time? Tell them when you’ll be able to provide an update on the subject. Keep them informed. Do not assume business is a unilateral relationship where only the person getting paid has obligations. You’re giving them money, but they’re giving you value.</p>
